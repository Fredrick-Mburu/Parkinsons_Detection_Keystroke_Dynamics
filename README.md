# Parkinsons_Detection_Keystroke_Dynamics
This project aims to develop a predictive model for detecting Parkinson's Disease through the analysis of keystroke dynamics. Utilizing various machine learning techniques, the project analyzes patterns in typing rhythm to identify potential cases of Parkinson's. This approach offers a non-invasive and accessible method for early screening.
